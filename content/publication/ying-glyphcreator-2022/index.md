abstract: Circular glyphs are used across disparate ﬁelds to represent multidimensional
  data. However, although these glyphs are extremely effective, creating them is often
  laborious, even for those with professional design skills. This paper presents GlyphCreator,
  an interactive tool for the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an
  example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator promptly generates
  a list of design candidates, any of which can be edited to satisfy the requirements
  of a particular representation. To develop GlyphCreator, we ﬁrst derive a design
  space of circular glyphs by summarizing relationships between different visual elements.
  With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning
  model for glyph parsing. The model can deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into
  a series of visual elements. Next, we introduce an interface that helps users bind
  the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate
  the parsing model through a quantitative experiment, demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator
  through two use scenarios, and validate its effectiveness through user interviews.
